# Talking with the Linux Kernel - A Beginners Guide to Netlink

From time to time I like to learn something new and it always starts with thougts like "Hm... I wonder how I can programmatically scan for SSIDs on Linux". The only issue is: I never really worked on Linux and I never programmed something on/for Linux before. So in this little tutorial I want to present what I learned about Netlink, from (Linux) beginner, for Linux beginner. I hope this helps some people who are also interested in this topic.

## What is Netlink?
